# COVID-19 Lab Health Plan

_**08/17/20 UPDATE:** ISB began a staggered reopening process in late June, where a few employees are added to the list of authorized on-site staff each week until the end of October. Everyone in my group is encouraged to continue working on computational projects from home. However, if you wish to be added to the on-site staff list, please let me know. I understand how difficult it can be to work from home. ISB facilities have been doing a great job maintaining on-site safety. Masks are required to be worn inside the building at all times, unless you are properly distancing in the dining areas or in a room alone with a door that can be closed. If you wish to have a quiet room to work in without a mask, you are welcome to use my office (Room 359) if it is not already in use (I am rarely at ISB)._

_**03/14/20 UPDATE:** [Asymptomatic transmission of SARS-CoV-2 appears to be a common mechanism of community spread](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/14/health/coronavirus-asymptomatic-spread/index.html). I've seen a few preprints and news stories hinting at this over the past few weeks, but I think the evidence is now clear. Based on what I'm reading, it seems like as many as half of all cases are asymptomatic. And these asymptomatic carriers seem to shed a lot of virus, meaning that they are vectors for passing it along to others. Another reason why it's important for folks to stay home and avoid contributing to the spread (especially those who are low-risk)._

_**03/11/20 UPDATE:** [WHO officially declares that COVID-19 has gone pandemic](https://www.statnews.com/2020/03/11/who-declares-the-coronavirus-outbreak-a-pandemic/)_

_**03/09/20 UPDATE:** As per ISB's latest policy, all those who do not need to come into the lab should work from home until further notice._

_**03/04/20 UPDATE:** [Two new SARS-CoV-2 genomes sequenced today](https://twitter.com/trvrb/status/1235432204060131329). Data suggest that the second lineage was imported from outside US and that there is likely only one transmission chain within Western Washington. Simulations suggest that there are likely ~600 current infections (90% confidence interval = 80-1500)._

_**03/03/20 UPDATE:** [9 deaths (total) of coronavirus in the Seattle area](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/03/world/coronavirus-live-news-updates.html). Two of these deaths were up to 6 days ago, and only attributed to COVID-19 recently. Assuming a 1-2% mortality rate among those infected, it is now certain that there is a major outbreak in King County with hundreds-to-thousands of cases. Stay safe out there folks! See below for specific suggestions._

_**02/29/20 UPDATE:** I suggest you follow Trevor Bedford (from Fred Hutch) on Twitter for the latest news on COVID-19 in Washington. Bedford has [recently shown](https://twitter.com/trvrb/status/1233970271318503426) strong evidence that COVID-19 has been circulating in our region since January 19th, with likely hundreds of cryptic cases. Therefore, I suggest you avoid crowded spaces. Try to maintain a 3-4 foot distance between yourself and others._  

#### What can we do, as individuals and a lab group, to protect ourselves, our families, each other, our communities, and our research?  Here are my current thoughts, with an emphasis on activities related to our laboratory and our academic setting.

1. If you haven’t done so already, get your flu shot. It won’t protect against the coronavirus, and it doesn’t provide perfect protection against the influenza virus, but it will reduce the chance of getting the flu (and save health-care resources for others in need).

2. Make sure you and your household are prepared for a period of self-isolation or quarantine lasting 2 weeks, or perhaps longer.  This means stocking up on food staples and, importantly, any medicines that you and your household need.  For medicines, I suggest having at least a full month’s supply, maybe longer, in case there are disruptions to availability.  Talk to your doctor about extending prescriptions or any other special needs you might have.

3. If you develop symptoms of a cold or flu—even mild symptoms—please stay at home and don’t come into the office or the lab.  We don’t want you to spread the infection.  Just email the group list or use the #general Slack channel to let us know what’s up, and work from home on your writing and reading if you feel up to it. You won’t impress me, or anyone, by trying to work while you’re sick. **Symptoms to look out for:** [WHO is saying](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019) that most individuals exhibit a fever and a dry cough at the onset of disease. If you don't have a thermometer at home, it would be a good idea to purchase one & monitor yourself periodically. If you have a temperature of 100 or more for a few hours, please let us know, stay home. If you have mild symptoms, please don't go to the hospital -- just stay home and rest (check in with a doctor via phone if you are concerned). If you experience any difficulty breathing, seek immediate medical attention (call ahead to see which hospital/location in your area will be best to visit).

4. If a member of your household becomes ill, see and follow point 3 above.

5. Let’s all start practicing more restrained physical interactions, and thus set good examples not only among ourselves but also for our colleagues and friends. That means skipping hugs and handshakes, for the time being.  Salutes, nods, waves, winks, and bows should suffice for now. 

6. This is probably not a good time to start any long-term wet-lab projects/experiments (not that we have much of that going on right now anyway). Don't commit to anything that forces you to come into the office. Focus on computational work and writing for now.

7. Be prepared to cancel your attendance at scientific conferences and other academic or social events as new information arises. Even if an event organizer decides to push ahead, you don’t have to go if you feel it is risky for you personally. I recommend delaying purchases of airfares until an event is closer in time, given the current uncertainty.  (Refundable tickets on most airlines are very expensive, and other tickets have restrictions.)  Hotel reservations can usually be cancelled on shorter notice (a day or week, check to be sure), but not if they were booked through a discounter.

9. And maybe the hardest advice of all is to practice good personal hygiene. Cover your mouth with your forearm or the inside of your elbow when you cough or sneeze. If you find yourself coughing or sneezing repeatedly, see point 3 above. Wash your hands thoroughly after you’ve touched shared surfaces, especially before eating. And most difficult of all, avoid touching your own face.  This coronavirus can survive for hours as tiny droplets on surfaces, which we may inadvertently touch (“fomite transmission”). Then, when we touch our mouth, nose, or eyes, we can infect ourselves. Experts suggest wearing face masks for both healthy and sick individuals who are in public areas that do not allow for adequate social distancing (e.g. grocery store, post-office, pulbic transit, etc.) to prevent dispersal and inhalation of virus-containing arisols.

11. If you do isolate yourself, whether because of illness or concern, make sure to maintain frequent social contact with your family, friends, and the lab via phone, email, Slack, or whatever works best for you. Don’t let physical isolation and loneliness make you feel miserable. We are all stronger together, even if we might have to be physically apart.
